This project explores commuting trends by gender using American Community Survey data. 

**Tech Details**
Efforts have been made to make this code as reproducible as possible. However, some limitations apply. 
- Requires Census key to run --> https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html (Further instructions in code files)
- Requires download of CTPP data (NY_SpatialEmploymnet) --> http://data5.ctpp.transportation.org/ctpp/ (Useful guide to using CTPP: http://ctpp.transportation.org/Documents/CTPP_tutorial_v02.pdf)

**Purpose** 

ACS_Commuting_Gender_Trends explores trends at a nationwide level for the 10 largests Combined Statistical Areas (CSAs), an aggreagated Census geography of interconnected urban areas. 

NY_SpatialEmployment digs a bit deeper by looking just at the New York area, and integrating employment data from the Census Transportation Planning Product (CTPP) tool. 


**Findings**

Overall, both in New York and across the largest CSAs, it is found that women commute for less time than men on average and are more likely to use public transit.
